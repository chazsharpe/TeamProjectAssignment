            <p>Mathematics plays a crucial role in computer science, serving as the foundation for many concepts and techniques used in programming and problem-solving. One way mathematics is used is through algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. These algorithms often involve mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For instance, when writing code to calculate the average of a set of numbers, mathematical formulas such as summing the numbers and dividing by the count are employed. Moreover, mathematical concepts like geometry and trigonometry are utilized in computer graphics to render shapes and create realistic images in video games and animations.</p>

        <div class="card-back">
            <p>In computer science, networks and security play pivotal roles in ensuring the reliability, integrity, and confidentiality of information exchanged over digital systems. Networks facilitate the communication and sharing of resources among computers and devices, enabling seamless interactions and collaborations across vast distances. Whether it's accessing websites, sending emails, or streaming videos, networks underpin almost every aspect of our digital lives. However, with this connectivity comes the need for robust security measures to protect against various threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks. Security in computer science involves implementing mechanisms such as encryption, authentication, access control, and intrusion detection to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the privacy and trustworthiness of digital transactions. From securing financial transactions to protecting personal data, the intersection of networks and security is essential in maintaining the integrity and functionality of modern computing systems.</p    >
